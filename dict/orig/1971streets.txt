            FOREWORD 



            This list of streets, courts, places, etc., includes all of the 
            known named ways within the City of Boston. 

            PUBLIC WAYS and PRIVATE WAYS open to public travel are 
            shown in boldface type and are designated by names which have 
            been assigned at some time in accordance with public statute. 

            PRIVATE WAYS not open to public travel, consisting of many 
            alleys and small passageways or "paper" streets not yet developed, 
            are shown in lightface type and are identified by names assigned 
            by abutting property owners or developers. 

            The designations "public ways" or "private ways" are based 
            upon official records of this department in most cases, but, due to 
            the possibility of typographical error, indefinite or incomplete 
            ancient street records, this book should be used for general in- 
            formation only.
